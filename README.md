Documentation for QuickEndpoint API Example
Overview
This documentation outlines the structure and functionality of a simple ASP.NET Core API project named QuickEndpoint_ApiExample. The project demonstrates CRUD operations on a list of books, showcasing endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting book entries. It also includes a setup for deploying the application as a service on a Linux system using systemd.

Project Structure
The project is divided into several key components:

BooksController: Defines the API endpoints for handling book-related operations.
Book Model: Represents the book data structure.
Web Application Setup: Configures the web application and its services.
InstallerScriptGenerator: Generates a bash script for deploying the application as a systemd service.
Deployment Process: Automates the publication and packaging of the application for deployment.
BooksController
Located under QuickEndpoint_ApiExample, BooksController is an API controller class that manages a static list of books and provides endpoints for CRUD operations:

GET /Books: Returns a list of all books.
GET /Books/{id}: Retrieves a single book by its ID.
POST /Books: Adds a new book to the list.
PUT /Books/{id}: Updates an existing book by its ID.
DELETE /Books/{id}: Removes a book from the list by its ID.
PATCH /Books/{id}: Applies partial updates to a book.
Book Model
The Book class defines the structure of a book object with properties for Id, Title, Author, and Year. This model is used to create and manipulate book data throughout the API.

Web Application Setup
The web application is configured in the Program.cs file, where services such as controllers, Swagger (for API documentation), and HTTPS redirection are registered. This setup includes the necessary configurations to run the application and expose the defined endpoints.

InstallerScriptGenerator
InstallerScriptGenerator is a utility class designed to generate a bash script for installing the application as a systemd service on a Linux system. It takes parameters like the application name, path to the tar.gz archive, and the entry point DLL, replacing placeholders in a script template to produce a custom installation script.

Deployment Process
The deployment process is automated through a script in Program.cs that performs the following steps:

Creates necessary directories for publishing and archiving the application.
Deletes previous publication and archive if they exist.
Publishes the application to a temporary directory using dotnet publish.
Packages the published application into a .tar.gz archive.
Cleans up the temporary publication directory.
Usage
Running the API
To run the API, execute the following command in the project's root directory:

shell
Copy code
dotnet run
This command starts the web application, making the API endpoints accessible via the configured port.

Deploying the API as a Service
To deploy the API as a systemd service, first ensure that the application is published and packaged. Then, run the generated bash script from the InstallerScriptGenerator to install and start the service.

Conclusion
The QuickEndpoint_ApiExample project demonstrates a simple yet comprehensive example of building and deploying an ASP.NET Core API. It covers the essentials of API development, including defining endpoints, modeling data, and preparing the application for deployment in a Linux environment.
